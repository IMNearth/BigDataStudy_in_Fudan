### Task - Semantic Segmentation

Raw Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PDC0gkX5s

Model : https://github.com/DeepSceneSeg/EfficientPS



We process the video following 3 steps.

* Take a snapshot every 10 frames $\rightarrow$ generate 448 images with shape (1280, 720)
* Use trained EfficientPS to perform semantic segmentation on each image
* Save the segmented image sequence as a video with frame rate as 10 $\rightarrow$ generate a video with a duration of 45s

 The whole processed video is available at [pan.baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1puAEem0YfqMDxbLFCDZM7w) with extract code `krkp`.
